<h2>What is React and Next.js</h2>

<b>React</b> is a javascript library for building interactive user interfaces.<br>
<b>Next.</b> is a React framework that handles the tooling and configuration, along with additional structure, features and optimizations, like - data fetching, routing and caching.

<h2>What is DOM?</h2>
- DOM is an object representation of HTML elements.<br>
- It acts as a bridge between the code and the user interface.<br>
- When user opens a webpage, the server returns an HTML file to the browser.<br>
- The browser reads the file and constructs the DOM.<br>
- DOM methods and JavaScript is used to listen to user events and manipulate the DOM by- adding, updating and removing specific user elements.<br>

<h2>First Step</h2>
- I used VS code to create an index.html file.<br>

<br>
- a unique id is given to div and javascript tag is added, so that I can use javascript in the html file.

<br>
- Inside the script tag, a DOM method, getElementById() is added to select <div> element by its id.<br>
- New elements are added to the h1 element using DOM methods and appended to the <div>

- Now, when the file is opened in the browser, it would display the text.<br>

- HTML represents the initial page content whereas the DOM represents the updated page content. DOM contains the h1 element but HTML doesn't.<br>

<h2>Second Step</h2>
- React is a declarative UI library, i.e. it figures out how to update the DOM after the developer tells it how they want the user interface to be.<br>
- By using React we can reduce the amount of code written to manipulate DOM and it's time sufficient<br>
- Add react and react-dom scripts from an external website "unpkg.com" <br>
  Remove the DOM methods and add <b>ReactDOM.createRoot()</b> method to target a DOM element.<br>
  Create a root to display react components and add root.render method to render the react code to DOM.<br>
- A Babel script is added<br>
  Babel is a JavaScript compiler. We need this as in the code snippet before, "<..h1" is a JSX code.<br>
  <b>JSX</b> is a syntax extension of JavaScript that helps it to describe UI in a HTML like syntax.<br>
  Browsers don't understand JSX so Babel is added.<br>

<h2>Step 3</h2>
- There are three React core concepts : components, props and state.<br>
- Components are functions in react that return UI elements.<br>
- Here,  a function named 'Header'(the function name is capitalized to differentiate with HTML and JavaScript) is added.<br>
- A HomePage function is created and Header component is nested in it.<br>
- HomePage is thus the top level component and so is passed in root.render() with HTML like tags.<br>
